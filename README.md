# Northwestern Intermediate Graphics 
## Project A: Particle Systems
To see the project running, go to https://kylengelmann.github.io/graphicsProjectA/

This project uses particle systems to create 4 different objects: a cloth simulation, a flame, a ringed planet, and a flock of Boids particles

The project's physics solver uses mutliple user selected solver methods and a variety of constraints and forces. The project uses texture-mapped sprite rendering, diffuse, specular, and emmisive shading techniques, and point, line, and triangle, and triangle strip primiitives in order to render each frame.
